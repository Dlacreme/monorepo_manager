# Monorepo Manager

An easy to use application to help you setup & navigate your monorepo. It's a standalone binary that requires nothing but itself.

## Usage

Create a default 'monorepo.toml' file with
```shell
$ mm init
```

## Install

Clone this repository and then simply run:
```shell
$ make install
```

It will compile and move the binary to your ~/.local/bin/ folder.

*If you are not using ~/.local/bin simply use `mv mm $your_desired_path`*
